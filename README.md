# Ink & Voices

A collaborative database platform dedicated to promoting and cataloging works by women authors and authors from gender minorities.

## 📖 About the Project

This project was born from a personal need we encountered during our initial RNCP6 project development. We realized there was a significant lack of representation of women and gender minority authors in the most commonly used databases. 

Our goal is to create an inclusive, community-driven database that addresses this gap and makes diverse literature more discoverable for everyone.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Collaborative Contributions**: Community members can propose books to add to the database
- **Moderation System**: Administrators review and validate or reject submissions to ensure quality and accuracy
- **Public API**: Developers can access the database through our API to integrate diverse author data into their own projects
- **Focus on Representation**: Dedicated to highlighting women authors and authors from gender minorities

## 🎯 Project Goals

The ultimate objective is to provide developers and readers with easy access to a comprehensive database of underrepresented authors. By making this data available via API, we aim to help others who face the same challenges we encountered in finding diverse literary resources. Readers will also be able to look through our database thanks to our website.
